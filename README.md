# Poker
Java Texas Hold 'em game

### Done:
* Card, deck, table abstractions
* Turn and TurnNotification event abstractions
* Methods to determine a player's best hand 
  * e.g. from a player's 2 hole cards + 5 community cards, what is the highest ranked hand he can play
>1. Royal Flush 
>2. Straight Flush
>3. Four of a kind   
> et cetera

* Can play a round of poker via command line

### To do:
* ~~Fully implement players as well as a table object to store the data necessary to depict the current state of the poker game for a player~~

* ~~Create the functionality to play a round of poker~~

* Fix bugs and make sure the game perfectly represents how a round of Texas Hold 'em would work

* Integrate the created poker model into an MVC web framework to create an online poker game
